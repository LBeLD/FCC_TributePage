            <h3>The Beginning</h3>
            <p>From the Santana neighborhood at São Paulo, Ayrton Senna was born with the speed running through his veins. Encouraged by his father (Mr. Milton), at the age of 4, he already had an incredible ability with Kart and, from there, the passion for the accelerated engine only increased. At age of 9, he was driving jeeps with a dexterity characteristic of a lot of experience; at 13, he already competed officially. He finished at second place several times, which was not enough. That was when, in 1977, he could feel for the first time the taste of a victory - and decide that he belonged there.</p>
            <p>Senna’s development as a pilot started in his childhood, as the inspired boy dedicated several hours of his days training. In 1981, he started competing in Europe, winning the English Formula 1600 Championship - with a record of 12 wins in 20 races. It was during this period that he decided to use his mother's maiden name, Senna, because Silva is a very common name in Brazil. In 1983, he won the British Formula 3 championship with the Dick Bennets team, with 13 wins in 21 races, 9 of them in a row. He also won the Macau Grand Prix for Teddy Yip's Theodore Racing Team. The pilot was in top form and in an impressive rise - absolutely nothing was taking him away from the focus he had.</p>
            <p>He made his Formula One debut with Toleman-Hart in 1984, before moving to Lotus-Renault the following year and winning six Grands Prix over the next three seasons. In 1988, he joined Frenchman Alain Prost at McLaren-Honda. Between them, they won all but one of the 16 Grands Prix that year, and Senna claimed his first World Championship. Prost claimed the championship in 1989, and Senna his second and third championships in 1990 and 1991. In 1992, the Williams-Renault combination began to dominate Formula One. Senna nonetheless managed to finish the 1993 season as runner-up, winning five races and negotiating a move to Williams in 1994.</p>
            <h3>The Season That Never Ended</h3>
            <p>It was at the San Marino GP that Senna stepped up on what would be his last race. He entered the Tamburello bend. He lost control due to a broken steering rod. He strode straight to the side walls and shook himself violently. The telemetry showed that Senna, when realizing that he was going to hit, managed to reduce the car from 300 km/h to 200 km/h. At that moment, the entire Brazilian nation held its breath, waiting for any movement by the pilot. A slight movement happened, but it drastically worsened his brain damage. Rescued promptly on the runway, he was transferred to the hospital, where, a few hours later, he was pronounced dead. It was the end point of the athlete and the beginning of a majestic legacy.</p>
